She remembered how it would glint in the sunlight as he worked in the garden, the steady tick-tock a comforting sound during their afternoons together.
	\nEach scratch and dent told a story. The small nick on the glass was from a day spent exploring the woods, a memory of laughter and adventure. The watch was more than just a timepiece; it was a symbol of their bond, a connection to her grandpa's wisdom and love.
	\nFastening the watch around her wrist, she felt his presence with her, guiding her through life's uncertainties. The watch ticked softly, a gentle reminder that the essence of those we love remains with us, carried through time.",
