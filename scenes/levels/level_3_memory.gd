It was taken last winter, on a day that felt like it belonged to a fairy tale. Their breath visible in the crisp air, they had wandered through the snow-covered park, laughing and holding hands.
	\nHis arm was around her shoulders, pulling her close to keep her warm, his smile wide and genuine. She remembered the warmth of his touch despite the cold, the way his eyes sparkled with joy every time he looked at her. They engaged in a playful snowball fight, and sipped hot cocoa from the foodtruck, their faces flushed with happiness.
	\nThe photo captured a perfect moment, a reminder of the love and warmth they shared even in the coldest of times. It was a symbol of their bond, a testament to the joy they found in each other's company.
	\nAs she held the photo, she felt a wave of gratitude wash over her. No matter the season, she knew they would always find warmth in each otherâ€™s hearts, facing the future together.",
