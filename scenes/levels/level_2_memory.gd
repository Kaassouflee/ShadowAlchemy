	\nBut more than the moments themselves, it was the feeling they left behind. A sense of belonging, of being part of something beautiful and unbreakable. In those days, surrounded by her friends, the world seemed brighter, and her worries felt smaller. The weight of negative thoughts lifted, even if just for a while, replaced by the lightness of hope and the promise of new adventures. 
	\nWith a gentle smile, she tucked the photograph back into its place, her heart lighter and her spirit renewed. The road ahead was long, and there would be challenges, but she knew she wasn't alone.",
